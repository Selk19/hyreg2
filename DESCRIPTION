Description: Using this package EQ-5D valueset estimations can be done using latent classes.
      It allows users to address preference heterogeneity and use a data-driven subgrouping of participants while estimating EQ-5D value sets. 
      The code for estimating models is based on the R package `flexmix`. The EM-algorithm is implemented in `flexmix` and offers the opportunity for 
      users to write their own `M-step-drivers` (Leisch 2004). This opportunity was used to create an M-step-driver for the hybrid model likelihood as described by 
      Oppe and van Hout (2010) and Ramos-GoÃ±i et al. (2016). The optimization is done using the `mle2` function from package `bbmle` .
      The package supports both uncensored and censored data. Furthermore, heteroscedasticity can be taken into account using the `hyreg2_het` function. 
      It is also possible to control for different covariates on the continuous and dichotomous parts of the data and start values to be used can differ
      between the expected latent classes.
