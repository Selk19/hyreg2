Description: EQ-5D value set estimation can be done using the hybrid model likelihood as described by 
     Oppe and van Hout (2010) <doi:10.1002/hec.3560> and Ramos-Go√±i et al. (2017) <doi:10.1097/MLR.0000000000000283 >. 
      The package is based on `flexmix()` and among others contains an M-step-driver as described by Leisch (2004) <doi:10.18637/jss.v011.i08>.
      Users can estimate latent classes and address preference heterogeneity. Both uncensored and censored data are supported. 
      Furthermore, heteroscedasticity can be taken into account. It is possible to control for different covariates on the continuous and dichotomous parts of the data and start values can differ
      between the expected latent classes.
