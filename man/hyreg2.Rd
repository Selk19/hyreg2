\description{
Estimation of hybrid model for EQ-5D data

\details{
formula:  a typical R formula of the form y ~ x1 + x2 + … should be provided.
Additionally, it is possible to include a grouping variable for repeated measures
by using “| xg” where xg is the column containing the group-memberships.
 Formula will look like this: y ~ x1 + x2 +… | xg.  In flexmix, this is called the concomitant
 variable specification: the model is fit conditional on grouping, so that all observations with
 the same group are treated as belonging together when computing likelihood contributions.
 One possible grouping variable can e.g. be an id number to identify answers by the same participants.
 We highly recommend using a grouping variable, since otherwise the algorithm tends to classify all
 continuous data into one estimated class and all dichotomous data into the other.


dataframe: a dataframe having the following columns:
all independent and the dependet variable used in formula,
one column for the grouping variable if grouping should be used,e.g. id numbers of participants with
repeated measurements,
one column indicating if the observations belongs to continuous or dichotomous data
with the entries type_cont and type_dich, e.g. a column called "type" with the entries "TTO" for continous
datapoints and "DCE" for dichotomous datapoints, type_cont will be "TTO" and type_dich will be "DCE" then.
One row should match one observation (one datapoint).


start values (stv): the given start values must be a named vector if the same start
 values should be used for all latent classes. Otherwise a list of named vectors should be used
 if different start values are assumed for each latent class. There has to be one entry in the list
 for each latent class.  Each start value vector must include start values for sigma and theta.
 Currently, it is necessary to use the names "sigma" and "theta" for these values. If users are unsure
 for which variables start values must be provided, this can be checked by calling
 colnames(model.matrix(formula,data)). Here, the formula should not include the grouping variable part.


latent: in some situations, e.g. for controlling preference heterogeneity, it can be useful to
estimate the latent classes only on one type of data and afterwards estimate the model parameters on all
data. In such cases, input variable latent can be used to specify on which type of data the classification
should be done. If “cont” or “dich” is used, the input parameter id_col must be specified and gives the name,
i.e. a character string, of the grouping variable for classification. Some groups may be removed from the
data, since they have only continuous or only dichotomous observations. Then in a first step,
a model is estimated only on the continuous/ dichotomous data and the achieved classification is stored.
In a next step model parameters are estimated on both types of data using this classification, i.e. in the
second step, no classification is done but only estimating models with k = 1 on all types of data for the
classes estimated in step one. Setting input variable classes_only on TRUE, the second step is left out and
directly the estimated classes from step one are given as output.


Variables_both, variables_cont, variables_dich: It is possible to specify partial coefficients,
 which are used only on continuous or dichotomous data.
 Example:  Suppose different models should be specified for continuous and dichotomous  data:
 • Model continuous data: y ~  x1 + x3
 • Model dichotomous data: y ~  x1 + x2
 The formula input to hyreg2 must then include all parameters that occur in either model:
  y ~ x1 + x2 + x3
 The assignment of parameters to data types is then achieved via the input arguments variables_both, variables_cont, and variables_dich:
  variables_both = “x1”, variables_cont = “x3” and  variables_dich = “x2”.
 Every variable included in the provided formula (except the grouping variable ) must appear in exactly one of these vectors. One of the variables_ vectors can also be NULL, if no variables should be used only on this type of the data.
